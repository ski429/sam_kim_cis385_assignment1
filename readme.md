This webpage is the first assignment in CIS385: Programming for the Web.

I chose to create the skeleton of a portfolio page that I can continuously update as I learn and progress through
different web technologies.

There are 4 html files, 1 style sheet, and 1 image file: 
1. index.html
   - simple landing page
2. aboutme.html
   - a bunch of random blurbs about me
3. contactme.html
   - non-functional contact form
4. portfolio.html
   - list of projects that contain filler text
5. main.css
   - one overall stylesheet
6. sassy.jpg
    - picture of my cat
